# Checkpoint 33: Gameplay Systems Validation - Summary

## ✓ VALIDATION COMPLETE

All gameplay systems have been successfully validated and are ready for Phase 7 (User Interface).

---

## Systems Validated

### 1. Mission System ✓

- Missions display and track correctly
- Objectives complete and progress properly
- Navigation markers point to objectives
- Audio and visual feedback working

### 2. Tutorial System ✓

- Launches for first-time players
- Steps progress one mechanic at a time
- Practice area with visual indicators ready
- Progress saves and loads correctly

### 3. Resonance System ✓

- Object scanning determines frequency
- Constructive interference increases amplitude
- Destructive interference decreases amplitude
- Objects cancel when amplitude drops below threshold

### 4. Hazard System ✓

- Asteroid fields generate efficiently
- Black holes apply extreme gravity
- Nebulae reduce visibility and increase noise
- Sensor warnings trigger appropriately
- Damage calculations work correctly
