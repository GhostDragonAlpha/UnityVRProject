======================================================

Created: 2025-12-04
Task: Document the Layer Architecture for solar_system_landing.tscn

FILE CREATED:
✓ docs/LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md (910 lines, 26 KB)

CONTENT VERIFICATION:
✓ Layer 0 (Foundation) - Complete
  - Solar system initializer
  - VR system (XROrigin3D, controllers)
  - Spacecraft exterior
  - Environment and rendering
  
✓ Layer 1 (Life Support) - Implemented
  - Scripts: scripts/planetary_survival/systems/life_support_system.gd
  - Scene node: LifeSupportSystem in solar_system_landing.tscn
  - Features: Oxygen management, Temperature control
  
✓ Layer 2 (Inventory) - Planned
  - Documented as planned layer
  - Dependencies mapped (depends on Layer 1)
  
✓ Layer 3 (Resources) - Implemented
  - Scripts: scripts/planetary_survival/systems/resource_system.gd
  - Resource types registered
  - Procedural spawning documented
  
✓ Layer 4 (Power Grid) - Implemented
  - Scripts: scripts/planetary_survival/systems/power_grid_system.gd
  - Generation and consumption tracking
  - Power balance calculations
  
✓ Layer 5 (VR HUD) - Planned
  - Status display widgets documented
  - Integration points with all layers
  - VR-native design constraints documented
  
✓ Future Layers 6-9 - Documented
  - Manufacturing, Trading, Research, Exploration
  - Dependencies and roadmap clear
