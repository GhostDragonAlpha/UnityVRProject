=== WAVE 8 COMPILATION VERIFICATION SUMMARY ===
Date: 2025-12-03
Task: Verify Godot compiles cleanly after disabling 8 blocking files

=== VERIFICATION RESULTS ===

1. COMPILATION STATUS: CLEAN
   - Total parse/script errors: 0
   - Total compilation errors: 0
   - Build completed successfully: YES

2. DISABLED FILES CHECK: PASSED
   - Files disabled by Agent 1:
     * scripts/core/voxel_performance_integration.gd
     * scripts/building/query_voxel_stats.gd
     * scripts/building/fabricator_module.gd
     * scripts/building/habitat_module.gd
     * scripts/building/oxygen_module.gd
     * scripts/building/storage_module.gd
     * scripts/building/automation_system.gd
     * scripts/building/inventory_manager.gd
   - None of these files appear in error log: CONFIRMED

3. CRITICAL FILES STATUS: ALL CLEAN
   - vr_main.gd: OK
   - scripts/http_api/http_api_server.gd: OK
   - scripts/core/voxel_performance_monitor.gd: OK
   - scripts/procedural/voxel_generator_procedural.gd: OK

4. RUNTIME ERRORS (NOT COMPILATION ERRORS):
   Total: 6 runtime warnings during scene initialization
   - Parent node busy: 1 (vr_comfort_system.gd:209)
   - Invalid owner: 1 (vr_comfort_system.gd:213)
   - get_node() with absolute paths: 3 (vr_manager.gd, save_system.gd)
   - Resources leaked at exit: 1 (resource cleanup)
   
   NOTE: These are existing runtime issues NOT related to the 8 disabled files.
   They occur during VR initialization/shutdown and do not prevent compilation.

5. OPENXR/VR WARNINGS (EXPECTED IN HEADLESS MODE):
   - OpenXR session creation failed: Expected (no VR hardware in headless)
   - RID leaks for OpenXR resources: Expected cleanup warnings
   - Desktop fallback mode activated: Expected behavior

=== OVERALL ASSESSMENT ===

STATUS: SUCCESS - COMPILATION CLEAN

The 8 blocking files were successfully disabled and Godot now compiles without
any parse errors or script errors. The compilation is CLEAN.

Runtime errors exist but:
- Are NOT related to the 8 disabled files
- Are existing issues in VR initialization/shutdown sequences
- Do not prevent the project from compiling or running
- Are tracked separately for future resolution

=== SUCCESS CRITERIA MET ===

✓ The 8 disabled files do NOT appear in error logs
✓ Critical files (vr_main, http_api_server, voxel_performance_monitor) compile cleanly
✓ Total compilation errors: 0 (meets goal of 0, acceptable <10)
✓ Project builds and runs successfully
✓ HTTP API server starts on port 8080
✓ Scene loads successfully (vr_main.tscn)

=== NEXT STEPS ===

The compilation blocking files have been eliminated. The project is now in a 
buildable state. Future work can focus on:
1. Re-implementing the 8 disabled features properly
2. Addressing runtime initialization errors in VR systems
3. Continuing with the wave-by-wave compilation cleanup plan

=== END OF REPORT ===
