SOUND DESIGN NOTES:
- Moon has no atmosphere - sounds should be muffled/dampened
- No reverb or echo (vacuum of space)
- Footsteps should sound distinct from Earth footsteps
- All sounds conducted through solid surfaces only
- Space suit and helmet add muffling to external sounds
- Internal sounds (breathing, cockpit) are clearer
- Spacecraft sounds are mechanical, not organic

LOOP CONFIGURATION (in Godot):
After adding .ogg files, configure in Godot Editor:
1. Select audio file in FileSystem
2. In Import tab, check "Loop" for these files:
   - engine_thrust_loop.ogg
   - cockpit_ambience_loop.ogg
   - jetpack_thrust_loop.ogg
   - breathing_loop.ogg
3. Click "Reimport"

PLACEHOLDER AUDIO:
If you don't have audio files yet, the system will:
- Not crash (graceful degradation)
- Print warnings in console about missing files
- Continue gameplay without audio
- Allow audio to be added later without code changes

Once audio files are added to the correct paths, the system will
automatically detect and use them.
