VoxelTerrain Integration Summary
================================

File Modified: C:/godot/vr_main.tscn

Changes Made:
1. Updated load_steps from 11 to 12 (line 1)
2. Added VoxelGeneratorFlat sub_resource (lines 49-50):
   - ID: VoxelGeneratorFlat_terrain
   - height = 0.0 (ground plane at y=0)

3. Added VoxelTerrain node (lines 91-96):
   - Parent: VRMain (root node)
   - Position: At origin (0, 0, 0) by default
   - Properties:
     * generate_collisions = true
     * view_distance = 128
     * collision_enabled = true
     * collision_layer = 1 (player interacts with terrain)
     * generator = SubResource("VoxelGeneratorFlat_terrain")

Integration Details:
- VoxelTerrain is a child of the root VRMain node
- Uses native godot_voxel addon (zylann.voxel) from GDExtension
- Flat generator creates a simple ground plane at y=0
- Collisions enabled for player interaction
- View distance set to 128 units for VR performance

Next Steps:
- Load the scene in Godot editor to verify the integration
- Test VR interaction with the voxel terrain
- Consider adding VoxelStream or custom generator for more complex terrain
- May want to adjust view_distance based on performance testing
