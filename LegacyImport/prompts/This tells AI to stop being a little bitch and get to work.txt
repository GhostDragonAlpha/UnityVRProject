> OK. You will follow the UNIVERSAL MANDATORY TESTING WORKFLOW.

Read: UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_TESTING_PROMPT.md

Execute the 5-phase cycle:
1. DECIDE - What to work on next
2. IMPLEMENT - Write code/files (use sub-agents for complex tasks)
3. VERIFY - Run: python scripts/tools/verify_godot_zero_errors.py
4. FIX - If exit code ≠ 0, fix errors and re-verify
5. COMPLETE - Report when exit code = 0

MANDATORY: Verification must pass (exit code 0) before completing.

When spawning sub-agents, pass them the same workflow from UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_TESTING_PROMPT.md

Zero errors is the only acceptable state.
